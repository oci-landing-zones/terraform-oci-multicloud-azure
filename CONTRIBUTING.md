# Contributing to the project

Oracle welcomes contributions to this repository from anyone.

If you want to submit a pull request to fix a bug or enhance an existing feature, please first open an issue and link to that issue when you submit your pull request.

If you have any questions about a possible submission, feel free to open an issue too.

## Contributing code

Before submitting code via a pull request, you will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and your commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off` or `-s`, e.g.

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA can be accepted.

## Pull request process

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`
3. Ensure that there is at least one test that would fail without the fix and passes post fix
4. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate your changes, ideally referencing the test. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well. We will assign the pull request to 1-2 people for review before it is submitted internally and the PR is closed.
